 ### _Young adults today have insecurities about their bodies. According to [now](https://now.org/now-foundation/love-your-body/love-your-body-whats-it-all-about/get-the-facts/#:~:text=Body%20Image,the%20time%20girls%20reach%20seventeen.&text=When%20asked%20%E2%80%9CAre%20you%20happy,their%2060s%20answered%20%E2%80%9Cyes%E2%80%9D.), 50% of teens are "self-conscious" about their bodies, with 26.2% reporting being "dissatisfied." Furthermore, the internet being a vast source of information, overwhelms them. As a result, many go down an unfavorable path that tends to lead them to unwanted results. Through our web application, we will create a better alternative to navigating their weight journey. We plan to allow young adults to become knowledgeable about choosing the right path in their journey through a TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure). Furthermore, we want to become an acceptable and engaging source of information that not only piques interest; but also supports the users in wanting to continue their progression through additional information & resources._
